# processing-graphics-assignment-2-draw-a-scene

**[Assignment Standard Operating Procedures](https://mariopineda.github.io/assignment-sops/)**

In this assignment your goal is to draw one of the following items or one of the following scenes:  
- house on a street
- old school ipod
- a car or truck
- a snowman
- a robot or MineCraft Creeper
- any other scene that you can think of

Your drawing must include:
- a resized window
- a new background colour
- at least 20 shapes, including the following:
  - lines
  - rectangles
  - ellipses
- multiple colours
- multiple stroke thicknesses.
- text

## Tip
Need to center a rectangle? 
- Start with: ```rectMode(CENTER);```
- Then specify the center points instead of the corner: rect(center, center, size, size)
- If you want to go back to normal rectangle mode:	rectMode(CORNER);

Need help with colour?  Try https://processing.org/tutorials/  There is a tutorial on shapes and a separate one dealing with colours.

Want to do a curved line? They are surprisingly tricky.  https://processing.org/tutorials/curves/ 

## Bonus Challenge 
Include at least 3 arcs (see the reference for the arc command) as part of your drawing.
